Vast amounts of data: collected, structured, measured, evaluated and optimized. That is how 
AI and machine learning are traditionally introduced to us. When we approach it from a 
technical standpoint, this perspective is, of course, valid. But, I know there is always a ‘but’. 
This perspective shifts our attention away from a more fundamental truth that “we humans 
have always made decisions without waiting for perfect data”. Long before spreadsheets, 
dashboards, or machine learning models entered our lives, decisions were made by memory, 
experience, and intuition. This leads to a simple but important thought that if we want to use 
AI wisely, we must first acknowledge that intelligence did not begin with numbers.

When someone says a Thursday morning 9:00 a.m. show will probably get cancelled because 
there won’t be much of an audience, this is mostly coming from a past experience and not 
from statistics and historical reports. We don’t label this ‘data’, yet we take decisions. We 
carry certain book quotes with us for years, recall fragments of conversations long after they 
happened, and hold onto specific events and memories while many others disappear from our 
life. These memories guide our choices, even though they were never formally recorded or 
quantified. 

Humans have a natural tendency to compare. We subconsciously ask what works, what works 
better, what feels better, what is more reliable, etc. We compare routes, career decisions, daily 
routines and we inherently do that. These comparisons are patterns. They form our belief 
systems. Just like most of us believe Mondays are unproductive. We do not arrive at this 
conclusion after studying productivity graphs or time logs. We arrive there through lived 
experience. Experience teaches us patterns, and we trust them without demanding numerical 
validation. Similarly, we avoid grocery shopping on weekends simply because we know it 
will be crowded, even when we have never counted the number of people inside. 

This human ability is strengthened by structured memory. Now, what? This is a right time to 
ask the question: ‘What is a structured memory? Is structure universal?’ When experiences 
are reflected upon, grouped, and connected, decision-making becomes better. A professional 
who pauses after each work-let, thinking about what worked, what didn’t, and why, slowly 
builds an internal structure. Without analytics or reports, the work quality begins to improve. 
This structure isn’t found in numbers; it exists in reflection. 

Uncertainty sits inaudibly at the center of all of this. We never have complete information. 
Even when we believe we are completely prepared, there are things that remain unknown. 
This is not a weakness of human reasoning; it is the condition of life itself. Every novel, 
every film, every story worth telling rests on this uncertainty and that is the beauty of life. If 
everything were predictable, there would be no tension, no curiosity, no becoming. 
 
AI enters precisely here. It offers memory at scale, pattern detection beyond human reach, 
and comparisons made at speed. Used wisely, it can support reflection and sharpen 
awareness. But it cannot replace our ability to live with uncertainty, to value meaning over 
measurement, and to decide even when information is incomplete. 
 
Life never waited for perfect data. The question is, now that we have machines that seek it 
endlessly,  
well,  
will you ask the next right question!??
