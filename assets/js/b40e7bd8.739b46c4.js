Long before spreadsheets,\ndashboards, or machine learning models entered our lives, decisions were made by memory,\nexperience, and intuition.

We\ncarry certain book quotes with us for years, recall fragments of conversations long after they\nhappened, and hold onto specific events and memories while many others disappear from our\nlife.

We subconsciously ask what works, what works\nbetter, what feels better, what is more reliable, etc. We compare routes, career decisions, daily\nroutines and we inherently do that. These comparisons are patterns. They form our belief\nsystems. Just like most of us believe Mondays are unproductive. We do not arrive at this\nconclusion after studying productivity graphs or time logs. We arrive there through lived\nexperience. Experience teaches us patterns, and we trust them without demanding numerical\nvalidation.
