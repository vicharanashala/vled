And it fills even those gaps that may not be necessary to fill. We all have experiences of seeing, hearing, or feeling things that might not exist. These experiences can feel very real and can also impact our senses. We might have heard our phone ring when it did not, we might have felt the phone vibrate when it did not, or we might have replied to a text in our mind when in reality we did not, and so on.

That little fancy of imagining things and falsely creating things, did it allow for creativity? When we don\u2019t observe patterns, we create stories. That\u2019s how we have tools, art, and ideas. The human mind going beyond reality is the reason we dream, innovate, and survive. For a beginner, the imagination that makes them worry a presentation might go badly is the same thing that helps them think ahead and prepare answers. People who imagine possible problems often end up doing better than those who assume everything will be perfect. The same quick mental shortcut that sometimes makes us misread a message tone is also what helps us catch social cues in meetings. Imagination is when your mind creatively thinks about possibilities. Hallucination is when those thoughts feel real without proof."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This also reminds us of something important about the systems we build and the knowledge we pass on. Any system that learns from human examples will naturally reflect human habits, patterns, and mistakes.

Information does carry assumptions, shortcuts and blind spots."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For the love of God, we hallucinate. That\u2019s how we evolved.
