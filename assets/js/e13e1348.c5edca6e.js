(Hallucinate - to see or hear something that\'s not really there)\\n\\nIf you said \u201cno,\u201d then you need to take some time to consider the questions below and rethink your answer. You can also still do it even if your answer was \u201cyes.\u201d\\n\\nHave you ever relied on information that did sound reasonable and later turned out to be fictional?\\nDo you sometimes create facts the way people create imaginary arguments in the shower? \\nHave you ever answered like someone in love, like the way they are confident even when they are imagining things? \\nDo you remember how you accept the \u201cI read the terms and conditions\u201d section?  \\nHow many times have you trusted and forwarded that WhatsApp forward?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nOur brain is very good at filling gaps. And it fills even those gaps that may not be necessary to fill. We all have experiences of seeing, hearing, or feeling things that might not exist. These experiences can feel very real and can also impact our senses. We might have heard our phone ring when it did not, we might have felt the phone vibrate when it did not, or we might have replied to a text in our mind when in reality we did not, and so on. That\u2019s just a ghostly version of the phone we have, and we can collect many such examples from the things around us.\\n\\nSomething to reflect on now is this: did this hallucination help in evolution? That little fancy of imagining things and falsely creating things, did it allow for creativity? When we don\u2019t observe patterns, we create stories. That\u2019s how we have tools, art, and ideas. The human mind going beyond reality is the reason we dream, innovate, and survive. For a beginner, the imagination that makes them worry a presentation might go badly is the same thing that helps them think ahead and prepare answers. People who imagine possible problems often end up doing better than those who assume everything will be perfect. The same quick mental shortcut that sometimes makes us misread a message tone is also what helps us catch social cues in meetings. Imagination is when your mind creatively thinks about possibilities. Hallucination is when those thoughts feel real without proof.\\n\\nThis also reminds us of something important about the systems we build and the knowledge we pass on. Any system that learns from human examples will naturally reflect human habits, patterns, and mistakes. If the input is incomplete, emotional, or biased, the output cannot magically become perfect or neutral. When we plant mango seeds, we only get mango trees. Information does carry assumptions, shortcuts and blind spots.  \\n\\nFor the love of God, we hallucinate. That\u2019s how we evolved. That\u2019s how machines may evolve too. If imagination helped us grow, could it be the very thing that helps machines learn to grow as well?"},{"id":"ThinkingBeforeNumbers","metadata":{"permalink":"/vled/ThinkingBeforeNumbers","editUrl":"https://github.com/vicharanashala/vled/tree/master/blog-page/blog/2026-02-07-ThinkingBeforeNumbers/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-02-07-ThinkingBeforeNumbers/index.md","title":"Thinking Before Numbers","description":"Vast amounts of data: collected, structured, measured, evaluated and optimized.

That is how \\nAI and machine learning are traditionally introduced to us. When we approach it from a \\ntechnical standpoint, this perspective is, of course, valid. But, I know there is always a \u2018but\u2019. \\nThis perspective shifts our attention away from a more fundamental truth that \u201cwe humans \\nhave always made decisions without waiting for perfect data\u201d. Long before spreadsheets, \\ndashboards, or machine learning models entered our lives, decisions were made by memory, \\nexperience, and intuition. This leads to a simple but important thought that if we want to use \\nAI wisely, we must first acknowledge that intelligence did not begin with numbers. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nWhen someone says a Thursday morning 9:00 a.m. show will probably get cancelled because \\nthere won\u2019t be much of an audience, this is mostly coming from a past experience and not \\nfrom statistics and historical reports. We don\u2019t label this \u2018data\u2019, yet we take decisions. We \\ncarry certain book quotes with us for years, recall fragments of conversations long after they \\nhappened, and hold onto specific events and memories while many others disappear from our \\nlife. These memories guide our choices, even though they were never formally recorded or \\nquantified. \\n\\nHumans have a natural tendency to compare. We subconsciously ask what works, what works \\nbetter, what feels better, what is more reliable, etc. We compare routes, career decisions, daily \\nroutines and we inherently do that. These comparisons are patterns. They form our belief \\nsystems. Just like most of us believe Mondays are unproductive. We do not arrive at this \\nconclusion after studying productivity graphs or time logs. We arrive there through lived \\nexperience. Experience teaches us patterns, and we trust them without demanding numerical \\nvalidation. Similarly, we avoid grocery shopping on weekends simply because we know it \\nwill be crowded, even when we have never counted the number of people inside. \\n\\nThis human ability is strengthened by structured memory. Now, what? This is a right time to \\nask the question: \u2018What is a structured memory? Is structure universal?\u2019 When experiences \\nare reflected upon, grouped, and connected, decision-making becomes better. A professional \\nwho pauses after each work-let, thinking about what worked, what didn\u2019t, and why, slowly \\nbuilds an internal structure. Without analytics or reports, the work quality begins to improve. \\nThis structure isn\u2019t found in numbers; it exists in reflection. \\n\\nUncertainty sits inaudibly at the center of all of this. We never have complete information. \\nEven when we believe we are completely prepared, there are things that remain unknown. \\nThis is not a weakness of human reasoning; it is the condition of life itself. Every novel, \\nevery film, every story worth telling rests on this uncertainty and that is the beauty of life. If \\neverything were predictable, there would be no tension, no curiosity, no becoming. \\n \\nAI enters precisely here. It offers memory at scale, pattern detection beyond human reach, \\nand comparisons made at speed. Used wisely, it can support reflection and sharpen \\nawareness. But it cannot replace our ability to live with uncertainty, to value meaning over \\nmeasurement, and to decide even when information is incomplete. \\n \\nLife never waited for perfect data. The question is, now that we have machines that seek it \\nendlessly,  \\nwell,  \\nwill you ask the next right question!??"}]}}')}}]);
